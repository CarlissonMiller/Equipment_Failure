# Case Description

## Introduction

To have a better understand on how u work, your strengths and weakness, we're proposing a challenge!

To enable the operations of an FPSO, we use sensors to make sure the equipment does not fail. These sensors measure different parameters of the equipment in different setups configurations (preset 1 and preset 2) over time. We want you to investigate one piece of equipment in different time cycles to understand what characteristics and parameters of the sensors might indicate that the equipment is on the verge of failing. To solve this problem, we expect you to answer a few questions regarding the attached dataset:

1 – Calculate how many times the equipment has failed

2 – Categorize equipment failures by setups configurations (preset 1 and preset 2)

3 – Categorize equipment failures by their nature/root cause according to parameter readings (temperature, pressure, and others)

4 – Create a model using the technique you think is most appropriate and measure its performance

5 – Analyze variable importance
